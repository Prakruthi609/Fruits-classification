# Fruits-classification
‚ú® Project Title: Fruit Classification Using Machine Learning üçéüçåüçä

I‚Äôm excited to share my latest project where I developed a Fruit Classification model using Machine Learning techniques. This project was part of my exploration in applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.

Key Highlights:
Tools & Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook.
Dataset: Kaggle‚Äôs Fruit Image dataset.
Objective: Classify different types of fruits based on their visual features.
Approach: Implemented machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees for classification tasks.
Achievements: The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between various fruit types, providing insights into feature importance and data preprocessing.
This project was a great learning experience, especially in improving my understanding of machine learning workflows, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
